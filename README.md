This repo shows the solution for
[Current_user present in socket.assigns for LiveView page load but not for form submission](https://elixirforum.com/t/current-user-present-in-socket-assigns-for-liveview-page-load-but-not-for-form-submission/54282).

See the repo commits for the steps.

The server memory cost is low for doing it this way according to
[Cost of stateful components](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveComponent.html#module-cost-of-stateful-components).

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
